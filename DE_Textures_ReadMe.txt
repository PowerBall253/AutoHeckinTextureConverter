------HOW TO CREATE CUSTOM TEXTURES FOR DOOM ETERNAL------

- Download & Extract Vega:
https://wiki.modme.co/wiki/apps/Vega.html

- Download & Extract Auto Heckin' Texture Converter by PowerBall253.

- Use a texture editor of choice (One that can read and export to .dds or .png), like GIMP:
https://www.gimp.org/downloads/


Copy or move Vega.exe into DOOMEternal's installation folder.

Open Vega.exe -> Load File -> DOOMEternal\base -> Any .resources file -> Search for what you want and select them -> Export Selected -> The exported .tga files will now be in .dds format (they are located in exported_files/images).

Open your texture editor -> Edit your texture (Merge layers if you are importing another photo on GIMP) -> Export as a .dds or .png file.

Drag and drop your edited texture(s) onto Auto Heckin' Texture Converter.bat (You can drag and drop multiple textures at once) -> It will now be auto converted to the correct .tga format (created in the same location as your edited texture).
